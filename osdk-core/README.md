## DJI Onboard SDK Core Library

This is the officially maintained DJI Onboard SDK library. The library provides a set of APIs for implementing the various functionality available through the [open protocol](https://developer.dji.com/onboard-sdk/documentation/protocol-doc/open-protocol.html). 

API class documentation is available through pre-generated Doxygen [here](https://developer.dji.com/onboard-api-reference/index.html). Documentation for the SDK has moved to the DJI Developer Website. Please refer to the [Development Workflow](https://developer.dji.com/onboard-sdk/documentation/development-workflow/workflow-prereq.html) for more information.
