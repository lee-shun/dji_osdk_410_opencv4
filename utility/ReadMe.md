## DJI Onboard SDK Config tool

DJI config tool has been renamed "MatriceSeries_ConfigTool" from "M210ConfigTool". 
Where we provide the source code of the implementation in the project, the specific 
address is in "Onboard-SDK/sample/platform/linux/config_tool".

When building the project, you can run "cmake .. -DCONFIG_TOOL=ON" to cover the 
building of the config tool.
